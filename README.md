# OpenFeature SDK for Rust

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This is the rust implementation of [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.
